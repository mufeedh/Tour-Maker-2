TOUR MAKER is an application designed to book tours of TRIPPENS’s tour operation company. Adventure tours, Package group tours, family package group tours, couple package tours, Ride tours, hiking, trucking etc. are available. This is basically not a customer focus app but for those who book tours on commission basis. For each and every tour package, company has fixed amount of commission for the agents on company’s wills.

For this application presently, we are not charging yearly charges or any registration fee. At this moment we have only 500Rs as service charges including tax. Tour payments are done only on GST tax basis. Bills and invoices will be done by TRIPPENS alone. And TRIPPENS will be responsible for all the tours operations.

Through this app we are not offering adequate income or a greater income. You get a commission proposed by company for the tours that you have chosen from the above.

The payments of the tours booked can be paid either through app or by bank through executives help or even from office within the time given by the executives. There will be an appointed time for the payment of booked tours and fail of payment with in that time given will result in cancellation of booking of the same. The responsibility of the balance amount of the booked tours lies with the agent alone.

The company have all the guaranteed rights to ban your login if we notice misuse of app by too much of fake bookings or unnecessary bookings.''';
